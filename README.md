Lifting Bucket, Running Away, Touching Fish and Waiting for Death...  

The images at the end of this are my code stats, I am not major in programming, I just write programs to try to make my life easier.

I don't like talk with strangers face to face but chat online is ok. Now I am mainly learning Shell, Python and C#, you can know what I learn by visiting my pinned repositories. Unlike other people teach themselves by reading books and so on, I mainly teach myself by writing a project and solve problems I meet.

Chocola, Vanilla, Capoo and many other cat characters are also my tastes, most of them are very cute girls, so I call myself a GNU/Lolicon. Maybe you like them too or you will like them in the future.

My English is not well, hope you can forgive my grammar mistakes in this file if possible.

Anyway, have a nice day when visiting my projects.

If you want to know where I get those picture elements, simply click on them, the browser will lead you to where I found them.
